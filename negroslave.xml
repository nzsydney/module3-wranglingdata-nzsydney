attention of the public, and, through them, of Parliament to the
subject. On the wisdom and justice of Parliament we place an
implicit reliance. Let the evils be only examined and ascertained,
and we cannot doubt that appropriate remedies will be discovered
and applied. Neither can we doubt that, in applying them, a due
regard will be paid to whatever claims <interp key="reason" n="citation" cert="high" ref="http://abolition.e2bn.org/slavery_110.html"> </interp> may
have on the liberality of the nation.</p>
<p>The present publication, it seems right to mention, has originated
with an association at <placeName key="Liverpool, United Kingdom" ref="http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Liverpool&params=53_4_00_N_3_00_00_W_type:city_region:GB"> </placeName>, formed for the express purpose of
employing all and prudent means for mitigating and finally
abolishing the state of slavery throughout the British dominions.
Similar associations are already formed in the metropolis and in 
other parts of the United Kingdom. But it became <placeName key="Liverpool, United Kingdom" ref="http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Liverpool&params=53_4_00_N_3_00_00_W_type:city_region:GB"> </placeName>, long
the deepest in the guilt of the Slave-trade, to come forward the 
first to protest against the perpetuation of the original injustice of
that criminal traffic, in the persons of the descendants of its earlier
victims. Such associations, we trust, will be multiplied in every
corner of the realm, and will never intermit their united and
strenuous efforts, until by exposition, petition, remonstrance, and
every legal method of intervention, they wipe out this foul stain
from the character of their country, and deliver themselves from all
participation in a system which, as has now been demonstrated, in-
volves the violation of every acknowledged principle of the religion
of Christ.</p>
